📊 Dashboard 1️⃣: Summary 📊

We made complicated data easier to understand by showing important numbers like how many people asked for loans, how much money they got, the average interest rate, and how much debt they had compared to their income. We also explained the difference between good loans and bad ones, so people who make decisions could know what to do next.

📊 Dashboard 2️⃣: Overview📊

Our Overview dashboard showed monthly trends, differences between regions, how long loans lasted, how long employees stayed, what people used loans for, and who owned homes. It used pictures and graphs to tell the story, helping smart decisions to be made every step of the way.


📊 Dashboard 3️⃣: Details 📊

This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of crucial loan data, borrower profiles, and performance metrics for those looking for detailed insights.

This project resulted in:

1️⃣-Efficient Loan Management: A single platform for overseeing loan applications, distributions, and repayments.

2️⃣-Knowledge-driven Decisions: Continuous updates provide stakeholders with the necessary information to make educated choices about loan approvals and risk management.
